# Detailed Mini-Dissertation Briefing

## Overview

The Mini-Dissertation is an integral part of your academic journey,
contributing **70%** of your module grade. It mirrors the structure of
an APA lab report, similar to the reports you completed last year.
However, in this task, nothing is pre-packaged – you and your group will
make all the research decisions, with support from your teaching team,
lab tutors, and personal tutors.

### Key Parameters:

-   **Duration**: 20 weeks.
-   **Group work**: You will be working in a group of 3 or 4 students,
    with each student researching a separate combination of IVs and DV.
-   **Focus**: The project will require you to design and conduct an
    original psychological experiment.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Project Components

### 1. **Identify an Area of Psychological Research**

Your first task is to select an area of research that interests you or
you think important - but this could be anything at all. There is no
right answer. This could be drawn from your past studies (Extended Essay
or Research Participation Scheme/Practical Issues module with Tegan and
staff last year), ongoing debates in psychology, or gaps in the
literature. You'll need to ensure that this area lends itself to an
**quantitative approach** (using a 2x2 ANOVA design) and that it's
feasible within the timeframe and resources available. Your Lab-Tutor
(and extended support team) want to help you with this!

**Action point**:\
Explore journal articles or speak with your teaching team to help narrow
down a research domain. Seek feedback from your lab tutors to confirm
that the chosen area is appropriate.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 2. **Literature Search and Critique**

Once you’ve identified your research area, you will conduct a
**literature search and critique**. This involves identifying relevant
studies, reading some of them to varying levels of detail, critiquing
their methodologies, and discussing how your project will build upon or
diverge from the existing research.

**Tip for the top**: Your Mini-Dissertation project will require you to
read a number of journal articles and text-books will not be terribly
useful. It is wise to aim to improve how you find and read journal
articles to get the most out of the process with least cost in terms of
time and stress. Being organised and strategic is key.

**Resources**:\
Make use of the readings provided in your modules, exploit all the tools
we identify in the labs, and use the library wisely. Consider this one
of the most important skills you will develop. Please make sure that you
learn to identify, and use, credible, peer-reviewed journal articles as
evidence in your Mini-Dissertation (and in your Critical Proposal).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 3. **Design a 2x2 ANOVA Experiment**

Your individual part of the group study must follow a **2x2 factorial
design**, where you have two independent variables (IVs), each with two
levels. This will allow for the examination of main effects and
interaction effects between the variables. Importantly, your design
should be **unique** within your group, but it is absolutely fine for
groups to work on similar topics. You will be given plenty of support to
get to this point.

**It is common when reading this in week 1, to find this unclear and
intimidating** Please do not despair, there are MANY aspects of this
process that will become clear only once you do it. Consider this an
opportunity to impress yourself once you overcome this initial
confusion. Your lab-tutors have done this loads, and it's the same every
year. Hang loose and trust us!

**Considerations**: - This is Research **Methods** and so always be
thinking about the methods you are using and the merit of them How will
you operationalize each variable? Does it sound accurrate and
reliable? - What tools or resources will you need for data collection if
you choose to use this method?

**Tip for the top**:\
Do not get hung up on the design in the early stages of the term. Just
look for a topic that interests your group, read around and see what
methods are used and what we already know. Design & Analysis will
introduce ANOVAs more. Gordon will demonstrate ANOVAs and you will see
examples in the coming weeks. It's not critical to understand this until
the second half of term 1, but you can engage with figuring it out
yourself using the resources we provide if you wish.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 4. **Develop a Testable Hypothesis**

Your hypothesis must be based on the literature you’ve reviewed
(otherwise it will be difficult to make a sensible introduction to your
Mini-Dissertation) and should clearly state **what you expect to find**
in your 2x2 ANOVA. There are going to be up to three hypotheses you
might have in your study, so keep notes about what predict will happen
as you go along.

**Example Hypotheses**:\
You will each have a 2x2 ANOVA design, meaning you will have a so-called
'main effect' of IV1 and a 'main effect' of IV2, and a possible
'interaction'. Pop a pin in those for now, but we cover this in detail
in the coming weeks in both Research Methods AND Design & Analysis.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 5. **Ethical Approval**

Before any data collection, you will need to secure **Ethical
Approval**. This involves submitting an ethics proposal outlining your
study design, recruitment methods, data handling procedures, and how you
will safeguard participant welfare.

**Signpost**:\
Work closely with your lab tutor to ensure that your ethics submission
is thorough. Templates and guidance is available, and students should
adhere to College guidelines on ethical research practices. This is a
crucial dry-run for your Y3 Dissertation, where you will do this on your
own. This year, Ethical Approval is expected to take a week. In Y3 it
will take about a fortnight, so it's something to plan for and to
recognise will never be something that can be rushed.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 6. **Data Collection**

You will be required to collect **REAL data** for your experiment. This
will involve recruiting participants, administering your experimental
manipulations, and ensuring data is collected in a controlled, valid,
and reliable manner.

**Key Tips**: Never start collecting data without trying everything out
and checking it works. Every year somebody only finds out their
data-collection didn't work as expected after they have spent a long
time recruiting and/or running the study. It's heartbreaking. But not a
problem this year. We have safeguards in place. But next year... It
might not be as simple.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 7. **Data Analysis: Conduct a 2x2 ANOVA**

Once the data are collected, you will conduct a **2x2 ANOVA** to test
for main effects and interaction effects. This statistical analysis is
essential to your Mini-Dissertation, so it’s important to understand the
process. You will all do exactly this analysis (taught in weeks 8-10 of
Design & Analysis). This will include Descriptive Statistics, Assumption
Testing, Tables, Figures, Inferential Statistivs (one of the 3 flavours
of ANOVA) with APA format narrative reporting of the results and
post-hoc tests as necessary.

**Stats Anxiety**:\
It is common that people will over-estimate the complexity of the data
analysis phase of this project. It is also common that people will avoid
thinking about it and hope it doesn't happen. It will. But here's the
good news. We know the analysis you need to do and start paving the way
early on. It's a focus of the second half of term 1 in Design &
Analysis, and we give detailed support too. We even give support to do
it using tools other than SPSS, should you wish. And it only usually
takes the lab session in week 17 to do. And as with all other parts of
this project, you can show your Lab-Tutor and get help all the way
through the process in the labs designated for that activity. By getting
anxious, you will likely avoid the tips and support we give about this,
and fret about something that takes about 2 hours to do in total. But we
understand. We've been there too.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 8. **Write the APA Report**

Your report must be written in **APA format** and should not exceed
2,500 words (from the first word of the title to the last word of the
Discussion). You should include the following sections:

-   **Title Page**
-   **Abstract** (150-250 words - this is part of the 2,500 word
    allowance)
-   **Introduction**: Summarize your literature review, state your
    hypotheses, and justify the research.
-   **Method**: Describe the participants, materials, procedure, and
    design in detail.
-   **Results**: Descriptives and Assumption testing, then Present your
    2x2 ANOVA analysis, report the main effects and interactions, and
    include post-hoc tests if necessary.Don't forget figures and tables
    as necessary.
-   **Discussion**: Interpret your findings, link back to the
    literature, and suggest implications for future research.
-   **References**: APA-style references of the works cited.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 9. **Supporting Materials**

Along with your report, you must submit the following materials: -
**Open Data**: The raw data you collected, anonymised where necessary. -
**Open Materials**: Any instruments, surveys, or stimuli used in your
experiment. Aim to allow perfect replication - **Critical Reflection**
(±200 words not included in 2,500 word limit of report - and you can
write more if you wish): A brief statement reflecting on the
decision-making process, challenges, and any adjustments that were made
during the project. How do you feel at point of submission? How do you
feel about next year?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Key Tips for Success

-   **Attendance**: Active participation in all group meetings and lab
    sessions is crucial.
-   **Collaboration**: Work closely with your group members, but
    remember, the final write-up and some elements must be your
    individual work.
-   **Paperwork**: Keep a record of your work. Consider this part of the
    project. It's going to be too much to keep in memory alone, and if
    you find a cool paper, or a piece of information you want to use in
    the write-up, it's not uncommon for it to hide when you need it
    most. Naughty, naughty.
-   **Reflection**: Keep a reflective diary of decisions made,
    challenges faced, and changes in your understanding. You will thank
    yourself when it comes to the Compulsory Reflective Account and the
    CHIP elements, which are this!
-   **Confidence**: Mistakes are expected! The teaching team will not
    penalize you for decisions that may seem 'sub-optimal' in retrospect
    (shows you are learning!). Penalties come from not doing the things
    we encourage or following the advice/guidelines, or just getting
    behind and losing track of what your group is doing.

## Final Thoughts

The Mini-Dissertation represents the culmination of the skills you’ve
developed over the past year. While it may seem challenging, the
extensive support materials and guidance provided are designed to help
you every step of the way. The key to success is active engagement –
from group discussions to lab sessions, don’t hesitate to ask for help
when needed.

Hundreds of students have done exactly this before you. The overwhelming
majority have even ended up saying they found it useful and not at all
as scary as they thought. Some even said they enjoyed it. But when you
exclude the people who fail by dint of non-attendance, and even the
people who pass but just miss out important bits because they didn't
listen, or left it too late, this module will often be your highest
mark. It will be the springboard to your 45 credit Final Year
Dissertation, where a good mark can really boost your final degree. And
the skills you learn here are worth a fortune. Just you wait, years from
now, when you least expect it, you'll unleash your critical faculties,
dive into some data, or just generally science the s\*\*t out of
something, and you'll mutter to yourself "Thank you, Team RM!"

You are very welcome. Smash it!
