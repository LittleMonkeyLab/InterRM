# Detailed Mini-Dissertation Briefing

Here’s an initial draft of your extended briefing for the
Mini-Dissertation. I’ve added structure and signposted areas where more
detail or guidance could be provided:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Mini-Dissertation Briefing

## Overview

The Mini-Dissertation is an integral part of your academic journey,
contributing **70%** of your module grade. It mirrors the structure of
an APA lab report, similar to the reports you completed last year.
However, in this task, nothing is pre-packaged – you and your group will
make all the research decisions, with support from your teaching team,
lab tutors, and personal tutors.

### Key Objectives:

-   **Duration**: 20 weeks.
-   **Group work**: You will be working in a group of 3 or 4 students,
    but the project must be unique to your group.
-   **Focus**: The project will require you to design and conduct an
    original psychological experiment.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Project Components

### 1. **Identify an Area of Psychological Research**

Your first task is to select an area of research that interests you.
This could be drawn from your past studies, ongoing debates in
psychology, or gaps in the literature. You'll need to ensure that this
area lends itself to an **experimental approach** (using a 2x2 ANOVA
design) and that it's feasible within the timeframe and resources
available.

**Action point**:\
Explore journal articles or speak with your teaching team to help narrow
down a research domain. Seek feedback from your lab tutors to confirm
that the chosen area is appropriate.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 2. **Literature Review and Critique**

Once you’ve identified your research area, you will conduct a
**comprehensive literature review**. This involves identifying relevant
studies, summarizing their findings, critiquing their methodologies, and
discussing how your project will build upon or diverge from the existing
research.

**Suggested Outline**: - Summarize key studies. - Identify
methodological strengths and weaknesses. - Highlight unresolved issues
or gaps in knowledge. - Justify how your experiment will address these
issues.

**Resources**:\
Make use of the readings provided in your module, and ensure you use
credible, peer-reviewed journal articles for your review.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 3. **Design a 2x2 ANOVA Experiment**

The experiment must follow a **2x2 factorial design**, where you have
two independent variables (IVs), each with two levels. This will allow
for the examination of main effects and interaction effects between the
variables. Importantly, your design should be **unique** to your group,
even if other groups are working in the same general research area.

**Considerations**: - How do the IVs relate to the literature review? -
How will you operationalize each variable? - What tools or resources
will you need for data collection? - Can you feasibly recruit enough
participants within the timeframe?

**Gap to address**:\
Further guidance on common pitfalls in designing a 2x2 ANOVA experiment,
especially if your group is unfamiliar with this type of analysis, could
be beneficial.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 4. **Develop a Testable Hypothesis**

Your hypothesis must be based on the literature you’ve reviewed and
should clearly state **what you expect to find** in your 2x2 ANOVA.
Ensure that it is testable and specific enough to guide your experiment.

**Example**:\
“If IV1 and IV2 interact, participants in condition X will show
significantly higher scores than in condition Y.”

**Gap**:\
It would be helpful to provide more detailed guidance on formulating
hypotheses, particularly for students who may struggle with writing
testable predictions.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 5. **Ethical Approval**

Before any data collection, you will need to secure **Ethical
Approval**. This involves submitting an ethics proposal outlining your
study design, recruitment methods, data handling procedures, and how you
will safeguard participant welfare.

**Signpost**:\
Work closely with your lab tutor to ensure that your ethics submission
is thorough. Templates and examples of successful applications may be
made available, and students should adhere to institutional guidelines
on ethical research practices.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 6. **Data Collection**

You will be required to collect **REAL data** for your experiment. This
will involve recruiting participants, administering your experimental
manipulations, and ensuring data is collected in a controlled, valid,
and reliable manner.

**Key Tips**: - Ensure consistency in administering your experiment
across all participants. - Be prepared for potential challenges (e.g.,
low recruitment numbers, technical issues).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 7. **Data Analysis: Conduct a 2x2 ANOVA**

Once the data are collected, you will conduct a **2x2 ANOVA** to test
for main effects and interaction effects. This statistical analysis is
essential to your Mini-Dissertation, so it’s important to understand the
process.

**Support**:\
You will have access to lab sessions and statistical support. Ensure
that you attend these sessions and seek feedback if you are uncertain
about your analysis.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 8. **Write the APA Report**

Your report must be written in **APA format** and should not exceed
2,500 words (from the first word of the Introduction to the last word of
the Discussion). You should include the following sections:

-   **Title Page**
-   **Abstract** (150-250 words)
-   **Introduction**: Summarize your literature review, state your
    hypothesis, and justify the research.
-   **Method**: Describe the participants, materials, procedure, and
    design in detail.
-   **Results**: Present your 2x2 ANOVA analysis, report the main
    effects and interactions, and include effect sizes.
-   **Discussion**: Interpret your findings, link back to the
    literature, and suggest implications for future research.
-   **References**: APA-style references of the works cited.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 9. **Supporting Materials**

Along with your report, you must submit the following materials: -
**Open Data**: The raw data you collected, anonymized where necessary. -
**Open Materials**: Any instruments, surveys, or stimuli used in your
experiment. - **Critical Reflection** (±300 words not included in 2,500
word limit of report - and you can write more if you wish): A brief
statement reflecting on the decision-making process, challenges, and any
adjustments that were made during the project.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Key Tips for Success

-   **Attendance**: Active participation in all group meetings and lab
    sessions is crucial.
-   **Collaboration**: Work closely with your group members, but
    remember, the final write-up and some elements must be your
    individual work.
-   **Reflection**: Keep a reflective diary of decisions made,
    challenges faced, and changes in your understanding.
-   **Confidence**: Mistakes are expected! The teaching team will not
    penalize you for early decisions that may seem 'sub-optimal'.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Final Thoughts

The Mini-Dissertation represents the culmination of the skills you’ve
developed over the past year. While it may seem challenging, the
extensive support materials and guidance provided are designed to help
you every step of the way. The key to success is active engagement –
from group discussions to lab sessions, don’t hesitate to ask for help
when needed.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

This draft provides a basic structure for the extended briefing.
Additional information on **specific challenges** (e.g., ethical
approval, data collection issues, and 2x2 ANOVA analysis) could be
developed further, alongside advice on **how to manage group dynamics**
and distribute responsibilities effectively.

Relationship between claims and evidence (argument) not clear or mentioned.                                       | Either some relevant background research, such as relevant theory and/or empirical evidence is missing or incorrectly reported. Relationship between claims and evidence (argument) not clear.                                                 | Background research is reasonably clearly presented, including adequate relevant theory and/or empirical evidence.
