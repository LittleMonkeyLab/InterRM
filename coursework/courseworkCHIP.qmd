# Detailed CHIP Learning Log Briefing

## Overview

The CHIP Learning Log is an opportunity for you to reflect on the
conceptual, historical, and integrative perspectives covered during the
year. It encourages you to engage deeply with the ideas presented in
lectures and explore how they connect with your own development as a
student, a future scientist, and a lifelong learner. The learning log is
divided into two reflective accounts, each of only MAX 600 words (not
including references) allowing you to explore 1) a key topic from
multiple perspectives and 2) document an aspect of your learning
journey.

### Key Objectives:

-   Present **two reflective accounts** based on relevant topics raised
    during the year. 1 Reflect on the relevance of a topic to your
    development as a scientist, a student, or possibly as an individual.
    Two perspectives are required. 2 Document how your understanding of
    a chosen topic has evolved over time.

A detailed rubric can be found on the VLE

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Structure and Requirements

### 1. **Two Reflective Accounts**

You are required to submit two reflective accounts, each addressing
different topics of the course and your personal engagement with them.
The reflections are not summaries of the material (at all - biggest
error) but are intended to encourage **critical thinking**, **personal
reflection**, and **engagement with broader themes** in psychology.

### 2. **Eligibility of Topics**

The topics for your reflective accounts can come from the range of
topics signposted during the term or with specific learning materials.
While this offers a great deal of flexibility, it is important that the
topics are meaningful to you and fit within the broader themes explored
during the course. You can choose an alternative topic, but it must fit
the parameters of the CHIP brief. They must be big-picture
controversies, debates, historical issues, or related to how Psychology
meaningfully integrates into your life, or how you meet Psychology.
Plenty of examples will be seen, discussed and proposed. If you are
unsure, ask on the Forum. Simples.

**Action Point**:\
Early in the year, keep track of lectures, readings, and discussions
that resonate with you. Consider how they relate to your development as
a psychology student or your future goals. Discuss potential topics with
your peers and ensure they are approved if not part of the signposted
topics. It's very quick, you don't need to write more than a quick
sentence or two to make sure it fits. NOBODY lost a single mark for
topic selection in either 2022-3 or 2023-4 (since we permitted getting
approval in the Forum from Gordon).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## First Reflective Account

The first reflective account must adopt **two perspectives** from the
list below and engage with a topic raised during the year:

-   **As a STUDENT of psychology**: How has this topic influenced your
    understanding of psychology or your approach to learning?
-   **As a TRAINEE psychologist**: How does this topic relate to the
    skills and knowledge you are developing for future professional
    practice?
-   **In relation to a RESEARCH application**: How might this topic
    inform or inspire your future research endeavours?
-   **As a HISTORIAN of psychology**: What does this topic reveal about
    the development of psychological theories or practices over time?
-   **Reporting on the CULTURE or PRACTICE of psychology**: How does the
    topic reflect current trends or challenges in the field of
    psychology, either locally or across cultures?
-   **As a critic or supporter of psychology's status as a SCIENCE**:
    Does this topic strengthen or weaken the argument that psychology is
    a rigorous science? Why?

**Signpost**:\
Choose perspectives that resonate with you or reflect your aspirations
as a psychology student or future psychologist. Ensure that the
reflection in your reflective account is analytical, not just
descriptive. Ensure that your reflective account is personal. I want to
hear your voice, I want to hear your perspective. I want to see you
write in a tone and style that helps convey your argument, it is an
opportunity to ditch that weird passive voice and use "I". It is NOT an
opportunity to be imprecise or write without sources, or to ignore the
guidelines.

**Example title**:\
Please notice that the 2 perspectives chosen are in the title. Is
Psychology a Science? From the perspectives of: STUDENT/FUTURE CLINICAL
PSYCHOLOGIST

**Short and Sweet**:\
600 words is not long enough to waffle. Know what you want to say right
at the outset, and keep it focused. Assume an interested and intelligent
reader, but make sure you give them enough to follow along, reference
key sources and explain terms if uncommon or important.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Second Reflective Account

The second reflective account focuses on **one starting point** â€” this
could be a reading, TED Talk, cartoon, TikTok video, song lyric, or
another source of inspiration. From this starting point, you will log
your journey of exploration into a relevant topic. This reflective
account should focus on how your understanding has developed over time,
and across multiple sources, and the personal learning process you
experienced.

### Suggested Approach:

-   **Identify your starting point**: Explain why this source resonated
    with you and how it links to the topic. This should be referenced or
    included (if feasible)
-   **Document your learning journey**: Describe how your understanding
    of the topic evolved as you explored it further. Did you encounter
    conflicting viewpoints, new theories, or surprising insights?
-   **Reflect on your experience**: How did you react to these new
    ideas? Did your initial assumptions change? What emotions or
    thoughts did the learning process evoke?
-   **Conclude with your key takeaways**: Summarize what you learned or
    rediscovered during this reflective process.

**Example**:\
You may start with a TED Talk on the replication crisis in psychology,
which leads you to explore various debates in research methodology.
Reflect on how your understanding of psychological science changed
through this exploration and what this process taught you about the
importance of research integrity and how that integrity will manifest in
your Final Year Dissertation - something that you feel is important.

**The spark**:\
This is easier if you actually do the thing. So give yourself a chance.
People usually wait until after they submit their Mini-Dissertation
before starting thinking about this. You are probably more interested to
start thinking about exams than another bit of pesky coursework. Why do
that? Keep some notes of topics that are unknown to you now or that
you'd like to know more about, track a few things you read and what you
genuinely learned and experienced. Real is easier. Authentic is easier.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Writing the Reflection

When writing both reflective accounts, keep the following points in
mind:

### Tone and Style:

-   **Reflective writing** is personal, but it should still be
    analytical and effective. You are not just recounting what happened;
    you are critiquing and exploring your thoughts, feelings, and
    reactions.
-   Use the first person where appropriate, but balance this with
    academic rigour.

### Structure:

-   **Introduction**: Briefly introduce the topic and the perspectives
    or starting point. Give us something to latch on to and get our
    bearings.
-   **Main Body**: Explore your chosen perspectives or journey in more
    detail. Ensure each reflection is well-structured and follows a
    logical progression. References and explanation of terminology is
    still necessary.
-   **Conclusion**: Summarize your key insights and discuss how these
    reflections have influenced your development as a psychology
    student, future psychologist, or lifelong learner. Bingo.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Key Tips for Success

1.  **Engagement**: Only 4 or 5 topics will get full lectures (in the
    second half of term 2) - many more will be signposted and indicative
    readings or recommendations for articles, books, or films will be
    given along the way.
2.  **Depth of Reflection**: Go beyond summarizing course content. Use
    your reflections to critique, analyse, and engage with the broader
    themes of psychology.
3.  **Personal Connection**: Consider how psychology as a discipline
    connects with your own development, both academically and
    personally. How do these reflections help shape your future goals as
    a psychologist or researcher? If I can't hear your voice, or your
    perspective, it's not going well.
4.  **Relevant Topics**: Ensure that your topic comes from those listed
    or meets the parameters. Feel free to use the Forum to check and be
    confident. There is no mystery in any of the coursework on this
    module. No hidden surprises or traps.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Final Thoughts

The CHIP Learning Log is not just an academic exercise but an
opportunity for you to reflect on your journey as a student and connect
the ideas presented during the course to your own aspirations and
understanding of psychology. Use this task to critically engage with
psychology as a discipline, exploring both its challenges and its
contributions. This is the last piece of coursework you will submit this
year, and could be one of the highest scoring - we had a number of 88s
in 2023-4 (and this is worth DOUBLE a Cognitive Essay!) all you have to
do is do what you are doing, jot some ideas in your daily journal, maybe
something annoys you and you want to vent? Great. Bring it.
