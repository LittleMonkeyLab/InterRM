key elements and signposting areas for expansion or clarification:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# CHIP Learning Log Briefing

**Deadline**: 10 am, 21st April 2023 (3 weeks after the end of Term 2)\
**Word Count**: 1,400 words\
**Weight**: 15% of your module grade

## Overview

The CHIP Learning Log is an opportunity for you to reflect on the
conceptual, historical, and integrative perspectives covered during the
year. It encourages you to engage deeply with the ideas presented in
lectures and explore how they connect with your own development as a
student, a future scientist, and a lifelong learner. The learning log is
divided into two reflective accounts, allowing you to explore key topics
from multiple perspectives and document your learning journey.

### Key Objectives:

-   Present **two reflective accounts** based on agreed-upon topics
    raised during the year.
-   Reflect on the relevance of psychology to your development as a
    scientist, a student, and an individual.
-   Document how your understanding of a chosen topic has evolved over
    time.

A detailed rubric can be found \[here\].

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Structure and Requirements

### 1. **Two Reflective Accounts**

You are required to submit two reflective accounts, each addressing
different aspects of the course and your personal engagement with it.
The reflections are not just summaries of the material but are intended
to encourage **critical thinking**, **personal reflection**, and
**engagement with broader themes** in psychology.

### 2. **Eligibility of Topics**

The topics for your reflections must be proposed and agreed upon by the
class. While this offers a great deal of flexibility, it is important
that the topics are meaningful to you and fit within the broader themes
explored during the course.

**Action Point**:\
Early in the year, keep track of lectures, readings, and discussions
that resonate with you. Consider how they relate to your development as
a psychology student or your future goals. Discuss potential topics with
your peers and ensure they are approved.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## First Reflective Account

The first reflection must adopt **two perspectives** from the list below
and engage with a topic raised during the year:

-   **As a STUDENT of psychology**: How has this topic influenced your
    understanding of psychology or your approach to learning?
-   **As a TRAINEE psychologist**: How does this topic relate to the
    skills and knowledge you are developing for future professional
    practice?
-   **In relation to a RESEARCH application**: How might this topic
    inform or inspire your future research endeavours?
-   **As a HISTORIAN of psychology**: What does this topic reveal about
    the development of psychological theories or practices over time?
-   **Reporting on the CULTURE or PRACTICE of psychology**: How does the
    topic reflect current trends or challenges in the field of
    psychology, either locally or across cultures?
-   **As a critic or supporter of psychology's status as a SCIENCE**:
    Does this topic strengthen or weaken the argument that psychology is
    a rigorous science? Why?

**Signpost**:\
Choose perspectives that resonate with you or reflect your aspirations
as a psychology student or future psychologist. Ensure that your
reflection is analytical, not just descriptive.

**Gap**:\
Some students may need more guidance on how to adopt multiple
perspectives effectively. Providing examples of reflective writing could
help clarify expectations.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Second Reflective Account

The second reflection focuses on **one starting point**—this could be a
reading, TED Talk, cartoon, TikTok video, or another source of
inspiration. From this starting point, you will log your journey of
exploration into an **approved topic**. This reflection should focus on
how your understanding has developed over time and the personal learning
process you experienced.

### Suggested Approach:

-   **Identify your starting point**: Explain why this source resonated
    with you and how it links to the topic.
-   **Document your learning journey**: Describe how your understanding
    of the topic evolved as you explored it further. Did you encounter
    conflicting viewpoints, new theories, or surprising insights?
-   **Reflect on your experience**: How did you react to these new
    ideas? Did your initial assumptions change? What emotions or
    thoughts did the learning process evoke?
-   **Conclude with your key takeaways**: Summarize what you learned or
    rediscovered during this reflective process.

**Example**:\
You may start with a TED Talk on the replication crisis in psychology,
which leads you to explore various debates in research methodology.
Reflect on how your understanding of psychological science changed
through this exploration and what this process taught you about the
importance of research integrity.

**Gap to address**:\
Provide more examples of what might serve as an appropriate "starting
point" and clarify how this should link back to course content.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Writing the Reflection

When writing both reflective accounts, keep the following points in
mind:

### Tone and Style:

-   **Reflective writing** is personal, but it should still be
    analytical. You are not just recounting what happened; you are
    critiquing and exploring your thoughts, feelings, and reactions.
-   Use the first person where appropriate, but balance this with
    academic rigour.

### Structure:

-   **Introduction**: Briefly introduce the topic and the perspectives
    or starting point.
-   **Main Body**: Explore your chosen perspectives or journey in more
    detail. Ensure each reflection is well-structured and follows a
    logical progression.
-   **Conclusion**: Summarize your key insights and discuss how these
    reflections have influenced your development as a psychology
    student, future psychologist, or lifelong learner.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Key Tips for Success

1.  **Engagement**: Actively participate in lectures and class
    discussions to identify topics that resonate with you.
2.  **Depth of Reflection**: Go beyond summarizing course content. Use
    your reflections to critique, analyse, and engage with the broader
    themes of psychology.
3.  **Personal Connection**: Consider how psychology as a discipline
    connects with your own development, both academically and
    personally. How do these reflections help shape your future goals as
    a psychologist or researcher?
4.  **Approved Topics**: Ensure that your topics are agreed upon by the
    class and relevant to the course materials.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Final Thoughts

The CHIP Learning Log is not just an academic exercise but an
opportunity for you to **reflect on your journey as a student** and
**connect the ideas presented during the course to your own aspirations
and understanding of psychology**. Use this task to critically engage
with psychology as a discipline, exploring both its challenges and its
contributions to your development.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

This draft lays out the key components of the CHIP Learning Log
briefing. More specific guidance could be added for structuring the
reflections, particularly in how to adopt multiple perspectives in the
first reflective account. Providing examples or templates for reflective
writing might also be useful for students new to this type of
assessment.
