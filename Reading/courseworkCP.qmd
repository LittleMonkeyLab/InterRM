# Detailed Critical Proposal Briefing

# Critical Proposal Coursework Brief 23-24

Write an 1,800 word critical evaluation on an empirical paper from a
Psychology Journal within your chosen field of research, including
critical reflection of how you and your group might improve upon it,
and/or build on its strengths.

-   70% of your mark will depend on the quality of your critical
    assessment
-   30% will depend on your suggestions for how your individual and
    group efforts in the Mini-Dissertation might improve research in
    this area. (See Rubric for more detail.)

**Important notes**: - We stop marking at 1,800 words. No penalty for
going over, but the words you use after 1,800 words cannot win you
marks. - Worth 15% of your module grade for PS52007D (30 Credits). -
Your reference list does not count towards the word count. - You must
use the Critical Proposal Coversheet and use ONLY your 8-digit Student
ID in the filename. - You must focus on an empirical article (i.e. an
article that reports the collection of quantitative data) from a
Psychology Journal. You are encouraged to confirm the suitability of
your paper with your Lab Tutor. - You MUST provide a full APA reference
to your chosen paper at the top of your essay. - You MUST include a copy
of the Experimental Design Schematic with information on at least one IV
(name and factor levels) and an effect size developed from the paper
(see week 3 lab materials). - Although lab groups are collaborative,
this must be your individual work, and collusion or plagiarism may
result in a penalty or misconduct review. - An AI declaration
(regardless of whether you used AI or not) is compulsory.

### Learning outcomes:

-   To encourage a deeper and more rigorous approach to reading
    published research.
-   Appraise the process of psychological research and assess the merits
    of particular studies.
-   Assess the reporting of research in published sources.
-   Critically reflect on how research practices may be improved, or
    strengths built upon, and the possible value of research increased
    in your forthcoming Mini-Dissertation.

Your work should be in an essay format with an introduction and critical
reflection/conclusion. It should not have sub-headings within the text,
but you are recommended to cover all of the general areas presented
below, with a focus on the most important aspects.

**The deadline for handing in your Critical Proposal is: Friday, 1st
November 2024, before midday.**

## Suggested Outline

### Summary (Compulsory and Important)

Provide a summary of the article in 150-200 words in which you capture
the essentials of the Target Paper.

```         
(a) What is the research domain and core question of the paper and what is of interest to you?

(b) What is the method that you are focussing on?

(c) What are the relevant results?

(d) Were there significant flaws or limitations in the study that might give you insight into your own research ahead?
```

### Research Question

Do the authors link their experiment to wider issues and theories in
psychology? What question is the paper trying to answer? Is the
hypothesis clear? Is it well-argued?

### Method

Is it clear and unambiguous? Could another (better) method have been
used? Could you carry out a replication from this report? Is the design
the most efficient for the purpose? Have broad theoretical constructs
been well operationalized into specific variables?

### Outcome

Is the Results section clear? Is the analysis unambiguous? Are all
analyses and statistical choices appropriate? Did the experimenter
answer the question?

### Experimental Design Schematic

You are required to complete details of one IV and an effect size (drawn
from the target paper) at least!

### Discussion

Are the inferences from the results justified? Well-argued? Do they
advance our knowledge? What further questions are raised by the results?
What experiments might be done to answer them?

### Suggested Improvements

Which aspects of the research project could be improved? Is there a
better research design? Are there extraneous or confounding variables?
How would you remove them? Could the results be more clearly analysed
and presented? Think also about which aspects of the paper itself could
be improved. Were the hypotheses clearly reported and well-justified?
Would you have displayed information differently (e.g., in figures or
graphs)?

### Critical Reflection and Conclusion

-   What were the key strengths and/or weaknesses of the paper? Did you
    find the paper clear? Do you think it provides a persuasive answer
    to the research question set out, or are there important limitations
    that limit its overall usefulness?
-   How will your Mini-Dissertation improve the research presented?
-   Why is it important that YOU do this research? How will you
    implement ‘Best Practice’ in the Mini-Dissertation?
-   What has this exercise taught you, and how has it developed your
    metacognitive abilities?
