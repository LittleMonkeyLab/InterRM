The student has presented a thoughtful and focussed reflection on how they might make a meaningful improvement in the research field. |
| **Format and Referencing**         | Is the proposal well-written, well-presented, with appropriate in-text citations and references?                                                        | The proposal is poorly formatted and referencing is either absent or very poorly inserted / inaccurately listed at the end.     | The format is adequate and there is some appropriate referencing, but there are also lots of inaccuracies and omissions.                                            | The format and referencing is appropriate for the most part, but there are a number of minor errors.                                   | Formatting is good and references are inserted accurately and appropriately in the text and listed correctly at the end.                                    | The format is clear and professional and referencing is to a high academic standard.                                                                                                                                           |
