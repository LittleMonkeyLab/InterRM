Examples are given below. Render this file to HTML to see how it works.\nNOTE: To use the widgets in the compiled HTML file, you need to have a JavaScript-enabled browser."

This chapter will explore the theory behind t-tests, demonstrate practical applications using R, and provide a structured write-up in APA style. Whether you’re examining the effectiveness of a new therapy or comparing cognitive performance between groups, the t-test is an essential tool for psychological research.\n\n\n\n\n\nA t-test evaluates whether the means of two groups are statistically different from each other. The most common types are the independent samples t-test, paired samples t-test, and one-sample t-test. Each type tests different hypotheses and has unique assumptions.\n\n\nThis test compares the means of two independent groups to ascertain if there is statistical evidence that the associated population means are significantly different.\n\n\n\nThis test compares means from the same group at different times (e.g., before and after a treatment) or matched pairs.\n\n\n\nThis test determines whether the mean of a single group is different from a known mean.\n\n\n\n\n\nIndependence: Observations within each group must be independent.\nNormality: Data in each group should be approximately normally distributed.\nHomogeneity of Variance: Variances in the two groups should be roughly equal (for independent samples t-test).\n\n\n\n\n\nTo conduct a t-test, you need to: 1. Formulate the null (H0) and alternative (H1) hypotheses. 2. Collect and organize data. 3. Check assumptions. 4. Calculate the t-statistic and degrees of freedom. 5. Determine the p-value. 6. Make a decision to reject or fail to reject H0 based on the p-value.\n\n\nResearch Question: Does a new cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) improve anxiety levels more than a placebo?\nHypotheses: - H0: There is no difference in anxiety levels between the CBT and placebo groups. - H1: The CBT group has lower anxiety levels than the placebo group.\nMeasures: Anxiety levels are measured using a standardized anxiety inventory.\n\n\n\n\nLet’s use R for an independent samples t-test.\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n\nThe t.test function provides the t-statistic, degrees of freedom, and p-value.
