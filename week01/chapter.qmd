# Chapter: T-Tests in R

## 1. Introduction

The t-test is a fundamental statistical method used in psychology to
compare the means of two groups. This chapter will explore the theory
behind t-tests, demonstrate practical applications using R, and provide
a structured write-up in APA style. Whether you're examining the
effectiveness of a new therapy or comparing cognitive performance
between groups, the t-test is an essential tool for psychological
research.

## 2. Main Content

### 2.1 Theory of T-Tests

A t-test evaluates whether the means of two groups are statistically
different from each other. The most common types are the independent
samples t-test, paired samples t-test, and one-sample t-test. Each type
tests different hypotheses and has unique assumptions.

#### 2.1.1 Independent Samples T-Test

This test compares the means of two independent groups to ascertain if
there is statistical evidence that the associated population means are
significantly different.

#### 2.1.2 Paired Samples T-Test

This test compares means from the same group at different times (e.g.,
before and after a treatment) or matched pairs.

#### 2.1.3 One-Sample T-Test

This test determines whether the mean of a single group is different
from a known mean.

### 2.2 Assumptions of T-Tests

-   **Independence**: Observations within each group must be
    independent.
-   **Normality**: Data in each group should be approximately normally
    distributed.
-   **Homogeneity of Variance**: Variances in the two groups should be
    roughly equal (for independent samples t-test).

## 3. Methods and Measures

To conduct a t-test, you need to: 1. Formulate the null (H0) and
alternative (H1) hypotheses. 2. Collect and organize data. 3. Check
assumptions. 4. Calculate the t-statistic and degrees of freedom. 5.
Determine the p-value. 6. Make a decision to reject or fail to reject H0
based on the p-value.

### Example Study

**Research Question**: Does a new cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)
improve anxiety levels more than a placebo?

**Hypotheses**: - H0: There is no difference in anxiety levels between
the CBT and placebo groups. - H1: The CBT group has lower anxiety levels
than the placebo group.

**Measures**: Anxiety levels are measured using a standardized anxiety
inventory.

## 4. Analysis with R Code

Let's use R for an independent samples t-test.

### Data Setup

```{webr-r}
# Simulated data
CBT <- c(23, 19, 21, 22, 20, 24, 25, 18, 22, 23)
Placebo <- c(30, 28, 27, 29, 31, 32, 33, 30, 29, 28)

# Combine into a data frame
data <- data.frame(
  group = factor(rep(c("CBT", "Placebo"), each = 10)),
  anxiety = c(CBT, Placebo)
)

# View the data
print(data)
```

### Conducting the T-Test

```{webr-r}
# Independent samples t-test
t_test_results <- t.test(anxiety ~ group, data = data)

# Display the results
print(t_test_results)
```

### R Output Interpretation

The `t.test` function provides the t-statistic, degrees of freedom, and
p-value. If the p-value is less than the significance level (e.g.,
0.05), we reject H0.

```         
    Welch Two Sample t-test

data:  anxiety by group
t = -7.05, df = 17.982, p-value = 4.34e-07
alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0
95 percent confidence interval:
 -10.428314  -6.371686
sample estimates:
mean in group CBT mean in group Placebo 
            21.7                  29.7 
```

## 5. Debates and Controversies

### 5.1 Assumption Violations

Violating assumptions (e.g., normality, homogeneity of variance) can
lead to incorrect conclusions. Robust alternatives or data
transformations may be necessary (Wilcox, 2012).

### 5.2 P-Value Misinterpretation

Overreliance on p-values can lead to misinterpretation of results. It’s
crucial to report effect sizes and confidence intervals (Cumming, 2014).

### 5.3 Multiple Comparisons

Conducting multiple t-tests increases the risk of Type I errors. Methods
like Bonferroni correction adjust for this but can be overly
conservative (Perneger, 1998).

## 6. Conclusion

T-tests are a vital statistical method in psychological research for
comparing means between groups. Understanding their theory, assumptions,
and correct application in R can significantly enhance the rigor of your
analyses. Always ensure to check assumptions, consider effect sizes, and
be mindful of the limitations and debates surrounding t-tests.

# Glossary

Certainly! Here's a glossary of key terms related to 'T-Tests in R with
theory, practicals, and write-up in Psychology APA-style':

1.  **T-Test**

        a significant difference between the means of two groups. It is
        commonly used in hypothesis testing.
2.  **Independent Samples T-Test**
    -   **Definition**: A type of t-test used when comparing the means
        of two independent groups to see if there is a significant
        difference between them.
3.  **Paired Samples T-Test**
    -   **Definition**: A t-test used when comparing the means of two
        related groups, such as measurements taken from the same
        subjects at two different times.
4.  **Null Hypothesis (H0)**
    -   **Definition**: A hypothesis that there is no significant
        difference between specified populations, any observed
        difference being due to sampling or experimental error.
5.  **Alternative Hypothesis (H1)**

        difference between specified populations, contrary to the null
        hypothesis.
6.  **P-Value**
    -   **Definition**: The probability that the observed results
        occurred by chance. A p-value less than 0.05 is typically
        considered statistically significant.
7.  **Degrees of Freedom (df)**
    -   **Definition**: The number of values in a calculation that are
        free to vary. In t-tests, degrees of freedom are used to
        determine the critical value from the t-distribution.
8.  **Effect Size**
    -   **Definition**: A measure of the magnitude of the difference
        between groups. Common effect size metrics include Cohen's d.
9.  **R Programming Language**
    -   **Definition**: A programming language and environment commonly
        used for statistical computing and graphics, including
        performing t-tests.
10. **Psychology APA-Style**
    -   **Definition**: The writing and citation style prescribed by the
        American Psychological Association, commonly used in psychology
        for structuring research papers and reports.
11. **Mean (M or μ)**
    -   **Definition**: The average of a set of numbers, calculated by
        summing them up and dividing by the count of numbers.
12. **Standard Deviation (SD or σ)**
    -   **Definition**: A measure of the amount of variation or
        dispersion in a set of values.
13. **Confidence Interval (CI)**
    -   **Definition**: A range of values derived from the sample data
        that is likely to contain the population parameter with a
        specified level of confidence, usually 95%.
14. **T-Distribution**
    -   **Definition**: A type of probability distribution that is
        symmetric and bell-shaped but has heavier tails than the normal
        distribution. It is used in t-tests, especially when sample
        sizes are small.
15. **Data Frame**
    -   **Definition**: A table or two-dimensional array-like structure
        in R, where each column contains values of one variable and each
        row contains one set of values from each column.

These terms will help students grasp the fundamental concepts and
techniques involved in performing and reporting t-tests in R, especially
within the context of psychological research adhering to APA style.
